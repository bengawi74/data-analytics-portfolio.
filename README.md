# Data Analytics Portfolio

This portfolio includes a collection of early analytics work completed during my transition from a long career in finance into applied data and AI. These projects show how I work with real datasets, prepare them for analysis, and communicate insights in a clear and simple way.  
They helped form the base for more advanced work with computer vision, natural language processing, and full-stack data systems.

## About This Portfolio

The purpose of this portfolio is to demonstrate practical skills in:

- Data extraction  
- Data cleaning and preparation  
- Exploratory data analysis  
- Introductory machine learning  

Most of the work here is done in Python using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Jupyter Notebook.  
Coming from a finance background, I approached these projects the same way I approached financial reports: start with raw information, organize it, make it clean and reliable, study it carefully, and explain what it means.

This work represents my first step toward more technical roles and prepares me for full-stack AI studies.

## Project Structure

This portfolio contains three main projects, each focusing on a different part of the analytics process.

### 1. Data Extraction & Cleaning  
Notebook: `02_data_extraction.ipynb`

This project shows how to load and combine information from CSV and JSON files.  
It includes practical cleaning steps such as handling missing values, correcting column formats, and preparing the data for analysis.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
Notebook: `03_eda.ipynb`

This notebook explores the cleaned dataset to understand its structure and identify meaningful patterns.  
It includes descriptive statistics and visualizations that help explain the relationships within the data.

### 3. Introductory Machine Learning  
Notebook: `Titanic_Logistic_Regression.ipynb`

This project applies a basic logistic regression model to the Titanic dataset.  
It includes model training, evaluation using common metrics, and a short interpretation of the results.

These early projects supported later work with YOLOv5 object detection, EfficientNet fabric classification, and a full-stack sentiment analysis system.

## Skills Demonstrated

- Python programming  
- Data extraction from CSV and JSON  
- Data cleaning and preparation  
- Exploratory data analysis  
- Simple data visualizations  
- Basic machine learning techniques  
- Organized project structure on GitHub  

These skills connect directly to the requirements of modern analytics work.

## Reflection

These projects helped me build confidence with core data tools. I learned how important it is to clean data properly, document each step, and understand the story behind the numbers.  
This work also helped me see how my finance background fits naturally with analytics. The attention to detail and accuracy from my financial reporting experience supported every step in this portfolio.
