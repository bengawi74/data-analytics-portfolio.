Data Analytics Portfolio
This portfolio brings together early analytics work completed during my transition from a long finance career into applied data and AI. The projects show how I work with real datasets, prepare them for analysis, and explain insights in a clear and simple way.
These foundations supported my move into deeper work in computer vision, sentiment systems, and full-stack AI.

About This Portfolio
This portfolio demonstrates hands-on experience with:
extracting data from common file formats
cleaning and preparing datasets
exploring and visualizing data
documenting analytical steps clearly
All work is done using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Jupyter Notebook.
Coming from a finance background, I approached these tasks the same way I approached financial reporting: start with raw information, clean it carefully, organize it well, and explain the results in a straightforward way.
These early projects helped prepare me for more advanced work in applied AI and full-stack systems.

Projects Included

1. Data Extraction and Cleaning
Notebook: week2_data_extraction.ipynb
This notebook shows how I loaded data from different sources, cleaned missing values, corrected formatting issues, and prepared the dataset for analysis.
It reflects the importance of starting with a clean and consistent foundation.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Notebook: week3_eda.ipynb
This notebook explores the cleaned dataset to understand its structure and identify useful patterns.
It includes descriptive statistics and visualizations that help explain trends and relationships.

Reflection

Completing these exercises helped me build confidence with core data tools. I learned the value of careful preparation, clear documentation, and thinking through what the numbers are saying.
My background in finance — where accuracy and consistency matter — supported my approach to analytical work.
These projects marked the beginning of my journey into applied AI and prepared me for deeper machine learning and full-stack systems.
